  </p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry ziti pasta</li>
    <li>1 pound mild italian sausage</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 large yellow onion, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 1/2 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce, divided</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded italian cheese blend</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil (Optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is
      boiling, stir in the ziti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta
      has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
    <li>While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, and cook and stir until brown,
      about 10 minutes. Drain sausage and set aside.</li>
    <li>Stir together the ricotta, egg, onion, garlic, and oregano in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in the
      drained pasta, the drained sausage, salt, pepper, and 1/2 jar of the spaghetti sauce; mix well.</li>
    <li>In the prepared baking dish, cover the bottom with 1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce. Layer 1/2 of the pasta mixture,
      1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce, and 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Then layer the remaining 1/2 of the pasta, 1/3 of the
      sauce, and 1/2 of the cheese. Sprinkle with basil. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Uncover; return to the oven and bake until
      cheese is melted, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
  </ol>
